# Employee-Payroll-System-Java
## 📌 Project Overview

The **Employee Payroll Management System** is a **console-based Java application** developed to understand and implement **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** in a real-world scenario.  
This system allows managing employee details and calculating payroll based on salary structure, deductions, and allowances.

The project is designed as a **learning project**, focusing on clean code structure, OOP design, and logical implementation rather than UI complexity.

----------

## 🎯 Project Objective

-   To understand **how real-world systems are modeled using OOP**
    
-   To practice **Java fundamentals** in a structured way
    
-   To simulate a basic **HR payroll process**
    
    

----------

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

-   **Language:** Java
    
-   **Concepts:**
    
    -   Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
        
    -   Classes & Objects
        
    -   Encapsulation
        
    -   Inheritance
        
    -   Polymorphism
        
-   **Interface:** Console (Command Line)
----------

<!-- ## 🧩 System Functionality

The system performs the following operations:

-   Store employee details such as:
    
    -   Employee ID
        
    -   Employee Name
        
    -   Basic Salary
        
-   Calculate payroll components like:
    
    -   Gross Salary
        
    -   Allowances
        
    -   Deductions
        
    -   Net Salary
        
-   Display complete employee payroll information
    
-   Maintain a clear separation between **data**, **logic**, and **output**

----------

## 📚 Key OOP Concepts Used

### 1. Encapsulation

-   Employee data is kept private
    
-   Accessed using getters and setters
    
-   Improves data security and maintainability
    

### 2. Inheritance

-   Common employee behavior can be extended for different employee types
    
-   Reduces code duplication
    

### 3. Polymorphism

-   Same method name used for different payroll calculations
    
-   Improves flexibility and scalability
    

### 4. Abstraction

-   Payroll logic is separated from user interaction
    
-   Makes the code easier to understand and modify

## 🧠 What I Learned from This Project

-   How to design a **real-world system using Java classes**
    
-   Practical use of **OOP principles** instead of theoretical understanding
    
-   How to write **clean, readable, and modular code**
    
-   Handling user input and displaying formatted output
    
-   Understanding how payroll systems work_toggleEffect is a logic-based application
    
-   Preparing code suitable for **future enhancements**
